    <h3>Some interesting facts about India's Independence Day</h3>
    <h5>Mahatma Gandhi could not celebrate the first Independence Day in Delhi</h5>
    <p>Even though the entire country celebrated their freedom from the British on August 15, 1947, the father of the nation Mahatma Gandhi <br>
         was away from the festivities to stop the Hindu-Muslim riots happening in Bengal.</p>

    <h5>The origin of the tri-color flag</h5>
    <p>The tri-color flag, which is the national flag of India , is based on the Swaraj Flag, which was <br>
        developed by Pingali Venkayya, who was a freedom fighter and a farmer from Machilipatnam.</p>

    <h5>India’s national anthem was adopted three years after the independence</h5>
    <p>India did not have an official national anthem at the time the nation gained independence.  <br>
        Even though Jana Gana Mana was written way back in 1911,  it was adopted officially and given the <br>
        status as the national anthem of India on January 24, 1950.</p>

    <h5>Why was August 15 chosen for India’s independence?</h5>
    <p>It was Lord Mountbatten, the last Viceroy and the first Governor-General of the country, who <br>
        chose August 15 to declare the independence of India. He was given the power by the British <br>
        Parliament to transfer the power to Indians by June 1948. However, he preponed it to August <br>
        15, 1947 to avoid bloodshed and riots.</p>
